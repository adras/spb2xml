# SPB2XML for MSFS 2020

## Changes from original
- Decode text values used in MSFS 2020
- Add propdef caching
- Recursive extraction

## Prerequisites

For Windows Store users, you will need to extract the 'base' packages to a location of you chosing.

See [this post](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/guide-how-to-extract-base-packages-from-windows-store-installation-directory/359035) for instructions.

## Propdef caching

Once you have extracted the MSFS 'base' packages to a location, you only need to point to it the first time using `-s`. 

Example: `-s c:\MSFS Base\Packages\fs-base-propdefs\Propdefs\1.0\` .

After that it will use a cache file called `propdefs.cache`, and you dont need to specify `-s` anymore. 

If there is a problem or something changes in the 'base' packages, simply delete `propdefs.cache` and use `-s` again.

## Recursive extraction

If you dont supply an argument for the SPB to extract, it will recursively extract all SPB files from the working directory with autogenerated names for the XML output.

## Known issues

- Only supports Windows-1252 encoded XML (fails on some 'translation' spbs)
- No idea how the model bank works and if it can be extracted from the installation

See [README.txt](README.txt) for details on the original implementation.
